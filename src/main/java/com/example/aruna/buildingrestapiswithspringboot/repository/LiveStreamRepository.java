// Repository is similar to dao pattern which is a kind of encapsulating some data acces. Here we are not going to
// talk to databases which actually complicates the things, rather we are going have an in-memory representation
// our streams, so list of live stream  is created here " List<LiveStream> streams = new ArrayList<>();" and is
// initialized to an ArrayList. And in the constructor for the repository a new stream is added which will be
// having a random UUID, descriptor, title, url, startDate and endDate. I have some methods to access them.
